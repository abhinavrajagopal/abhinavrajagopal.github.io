title: Can you slingshot at $$\it c$$ ?
---
The question is simple enough, could we use a gravitational assist to pull off a manoeuvre that would fling our spacecraft out of a hyperbolic trajectory at near light speed?

Let’s take a look.

Imagine you’re coasting around a planet with a mass that is large enough to cause a non-zero $$T_{\mu v}$$ and would like to perform a slingshot using gravity assist to get some traction for your next destination. As part of the escape hyperbolic trajectory where your spacecraft is moving relative to the massive object you’re about to exploit, you’re to be moving at non-relativistic velocities as at relativistic speeds you cannot be in a hyperbolic escape trajectory. From a basic standpoint, we usually recommend that objects (mainly satellites) need to reach escape velocity to leave the Earth’s orbit, but objects do not need to ever reach earth's escape velocity of 11,186 m/s , and many that leave orbit, don't. It mainly depends on where the object is when it needs to reach 11,186 m/s.

> With a hyperbolic trajectory the orbital eccentricity ($$e$$) is greater than 1. The eccentricity is directly related to the angle between the asymptotes. With eccentricity just over 1 the hyperbola is a sharp "v" shape. At $$e=\sqrt {2}$$ the asymptotes are at right angles. With $$e\gt2$$ the asymptotes are more than 120° apart, and the periapsis distance is greater than the semi major axis. As eccentricity increases further the motion approaches a straight line.

> The angle between the direction of periapsis and an asymptote from the central body is the true anomaly as distance tends to infinity ($$\theta_{\infty}$$) so ($$2\theta_{\infty}$$) is the external angle between approach and departure directions (between asymptotes). Then

> $$\theta{_{\infty }}=cos^{-1}(-1/e)$$ or $$e=-\frac{1}{cos\theta_{\infty}}$$

When coming to a flyby using gravitational assists, the object would need to enter against the massive body’s motion and exit with it’s acquired orbital energy at an angle. When flown in a hyperbolic path the craft can flyby without any additional acceleration from it’s engine, which further saves a bit of fuel. A pretty good flyby can be achieved if we minimise $$ \theta $$ between the massive body and the spacecraft’s exit path given by $$\theta=cos^{-1}(1/e) $$ where $$ \it e $$ gives the eccentricity of the orbit and must be $$ e\geq1 $$. Now, the ideal path to follow would be as we see $$ e\rightarrow\infty $$, the trajectory would be orthogonal to the body’s orbit, and no assist would be obtained, therefore a parabolic trajectory would ensure the path would be in line with the body’s orbit and as the velocity increases the $$ \it e $$ would increase which we don't want as 
seen from the flight path angle given by, $$\tan(\phi) = \frac{e.\sin\theta}{1 + e.\cos\theta}$$ and velocity from $$v = \sqrt{\mu\left({2\over{r}}-{1\over{a}}\right)}$$, where: 
* $$ \mu $$, is the standard gravitational parameter
* $$ r $$, is radial distance of orbiting body from central body
* $$ a $$ is the (negative) semi-major axis.

And from $$v^2 = v_{esc}^{2}+v_{\infty }^{2} $$ we get orbital velocity ($$v$$), local escape velocity ($$v_{esc}$$), and hyperbolic excess velocity $$ v_{\infty}$$), even a relatively small $$\Delta {v}$$ above $${v_{esc}}$$ yields us high excess speed of $$v_{\infty}$$ which is the Oberth manoeuvre that uses additional acceleration by falling into the gravitational well of the body (for heavier object such as black holes this would employ general relativity where the gravitational potential would change to a metric tensor). Using the heavy body, our sun for example if used conduct one burn at periapse, and get a significant boost above and beyond the $$\Delta {v}$$ of the burn, but you’ll still need something much more massive to approach the speed of light. So unfortunately for non black hole like bodies such as planets or even stars, this wouldn't result in much orbital trajectory deviation and nil transfer of momentum and velocity gained will be mediocre. 

This changes for objects with high densities such as neutron stars and black holes. If you've watched the film 'Interstellar', the techniques used to pull of flybys are still conditional and require a binary star system that are orbiting each other, and that the spacecraft which you're in happening to traverse from source to destination from one star to another. Kip Thorne theorises the slingshot around the black hole, through which the craft could attain enough kinetic energy even which cannot be affirmed to be close to ~ 0.5c. There's the concern of the limit our craft can hover within the Schwarzschild radius, $$r$$ and as we get closer to $$r$$ we can't exactly determine that at $$r=6M$$ we would use the slingshot, or if we could go further closer, and calculating the minimal orbit radius for an unknown binary star/black hole on the fly would be non deterministic and our desired hyperbolic or parabolic trajectory is hard to maintain as one moves closer to the event horizon where orbits run periodic. This complicates issues further as we leave Newtonian gravity and delve into the two-body problem in general relativity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_geodesics">Schwarzschild geodesics</a>, and the remote risks of falling into the event horizon beyond which, realistically, would end up in the singularity.
