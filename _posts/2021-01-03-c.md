title: Can you slingshot at c?
---
The question is simple enough, could we use a gravitational assist to pull off a manoeuvre that would fling our spacecraft out of a hyperbolic trajectory at near light speed?

Let’s take a look.

Imagine you’re coasting around a planet with a mass that is large enough to cause a non-zero $$T_\mu_v$$ and would like to perform a slingshot using gravity assist to get some traction for your next destination. As part of the escape hyperbolic trajectory where your spacecraft is moving relative to the massive object you’re about to exploit, you’re to be moving at non-relativistic velocities as at relativistic speeds you cannot be in a hyperbolic escape trajectory. From a basic standpoint, we usually recommend that objects (mainly satellites) need to reach escape velocity to leave the Earth’s orbit, but objects do not need to ever reach earth's escape velocity of 11,186 m/s , and many that leave orbit, don't. It mainly depends on where the object is when it needs to reach 11,186 m/s.

> With a hyperbolic trajectory the orbital eccentricity ($$e$$) is greater than 1. The eccentricity is directly related to the angle between the asymptotes. With eccentricity just over 1 the hyperbola is a sharp "v" shape. At $$e=\sqrt {2}$$ the asymptotes are at right angles. With $$e\gt2$$ the asymptotes are more than 120° apart, and the periapsis distance is greater than the semi major axis. As eccentricity increases further the motion approaches a straight line.

> The angle between the direction of periapsis and an asymptote from the central body is the true anomaly as distance tends to infinity ($${\theta_{\infty}$$) so ($${2\theta_{\infty}$$) is the external angle between approach and departure directions (between asymptotes). Then

> $$\theta{_{\infty }}=cos^{-1}(-1/e)$$ or $$e=-\frac{1}{cos\theta_{\infty}}$$

When coming to a flyby using gravitational assists, the object would need to enter against the massive body’s motion and exit with it’s acquired orbital energy at an angle. When flown in a hyperbolic path the craft can flyby without any additional acceleration from it’s engine, which further saves a bit of fuel. A pretty good flyby can be achieved if we minimise $$ \theta $$ between the massive body and the spacecraft’s exit path given by $$\theta=cos^{-1}(1/e) $$ where $$ \it e $$ gives the eccentricity of the orbit and must be $$ e\geq1 $$. Now, the ideal path to follow would be as we see $$ e\rightarrow\infty $$, the trajectory would be orthogonal to the body’s orbit, and no assist would be obtained, therefore a parabolic trajectory would ensure the path would be in line with the body’s orbit and as the velocity increases the $$ \it e $$ would increase which we don't want as 
seen from the flight path angle given by, $$\tan(\phi) = \frac{e.\sin\theta}{1 + e.\cos\theta}$$ and velocity from $$v = \sqrt{\mu\left({2\over{r}}-{1\over{a}}\right)}$$, where: 
* $$ \mu $$, is the standard gravitational parameter
* $$ r $$, is radial distance of orbiting body from central body
* $$ a $$ is the (negative) semi-major axis.

And from $$v^2=v_{esc}}^{2}+v_{\infty }}^{2} $$ we get orbital velocity ($$v$$), local escape velocity ($$v_{esc}$$), and hyperbolic excess velocity $$ v_{\infty}$$), even a relatively small $$\Delta {v}$$ above $${v_{esc}}$$ yields us high excess speed of $$v_{\infty}$$.
