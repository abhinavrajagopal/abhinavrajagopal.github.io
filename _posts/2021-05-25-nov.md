Days[^1] cycle by over the marginally arid land, bringing no respite to the soil thirsty for some hydration, trees stretch their splaying roots along their boundaries but are disdainfully stopped in their tracks by concoctions of concrete and metal woefully restraining the flora from unravelling their expanse, the place sustains a tranquil silence, the streets wearing a desolated look, except for the occasional chirping of squirrels and mynas tottering along branches, cuckoos and pigeons cooing, crows cawing, cows mooing for their calves, hopping, hiding within the constrained foliage of boughs, suspended cables and walls. Rain has been unpunctual this year for the land, taking on a rather dubious, arbitrary nonchalant evocation of its people. It draws in with teasing petrichor, heavy, short spells, at times going longer and showering enough to run full freshet through asphalt laden paths, marshalling strewn leaves, twigs, mustering muck, quenching the land and trees, promising a few months satiation. People here have a penchant for dissatisfaction, similar to most people, a mental construct of melancholic void of resources from the gods and nature, ironically enough preventing, encumbering the latter every step of their way in an attempt to conquer it. Every time a week of rain brings them joy, which lasts as long as the time itself, bridging the lack of it, until they turn vexed during the other times, the sweltering radiation from the sun bakes, toasts the dry land into further the humidity, a detriment of a costal sea bordering land. Wind currents drift aplenty, one prime mover of dust and air around this city, and the summer stretches oblong. During times of blessing, the living rejoice as one community, from birds, buds impeded from blooming flowers to humans. The people go about their plundering, casting along their wake, gathering land, planting food if they found the soil turned fallow, acquiring property, engineer and constructing concrete towers and encampments with their design to house, sell, live, procreate, and folly. During dry times, they grow sadder, and forget about the good times, longing for a break from the heat. In fact, it had rained more than usual that past year according to the meteorological data compared with the last couple decades. It has been a year and half that the cyclical entrapments of time have grown to suffocating heights that bring no dousing of calamity to mind, body and spirit of these people. Sweltering heat had been creeping up over the years, forcing the people more often to seek shelter amid shadows, or indoors, and blissfully engage in hydrating with coconut water, palm jelly, melon juice, lemonade, and rose milk. This year has been kinder, the summer got off to a torturous start bringing more despair amidst catastrophic loss, as if the gods were taking pity, the month of May turned around to witness some rain, which was a rarity, bringing probably the only respite to the city and its inhabitants. When you think about it, both man and nature do right by themselves, although contentious within one another, their dichotomy embroiled in a quest for survival. But all is not so healthy with the natural world. The human mind greedily probing, innovating, inventing new ways to take after being continually crevassed for its resources there comes a time when man does gain an upper hand, there have been increasingly frequent quakes, cyclones, tornadoes, ensuing deluges, temperature shifts and warming of the oceans, atmosphere, seasonal alterations, oblique precipitation patterns, carrying death and destruction along the way, and a disharmony seething with rage bubbling underneath the surface, we’re in dire straits here, thee thought. There is the catastrophe that we mentioned, a pandemic in which the global equilibrium was shackled, ousted into living in fear, loss and hope. No one knew how it began, or started, transmitted, and travelled all over the world, but few speculated about as they always do. The reality of this city and its country was that they did not care or couldn’t do so for they had tragically misplaced their lives for a trade with the grim reaper. Times had changed for the city and the country at large, their elected, government and those wielding power grew increasingly narcissistic, megalomaniacal, bigoted, stupid and seemed to have ulterior motives. It’s not that the previous ones weren’t, but they attempted to serve the people rather than rule or coerce their wills down their throats, despite their tendency to loot or squander. And so it had become that the powers that be had decided to celebrate their victory over this pandemic a tad too early, it was now May but their Prime and Health ministers had declared themselves triumphant over this virus back in January, a cardinal sin. People, having an instinct for the wild by nature, and being deprived of some of their freedom, awaited the authorities’ word as the assent on the matter, now resumed their wildness. Bureaucrats have turned sycophantic underlings of their masters, their motivation being to not jeopardise their jobs, when they formerly held them accountable and led their efforts to bulwark the integrity of their systems. On the other side, desperation and frugality among people was beginning to rear it’s head, resources were stringent, and money reserves rapidly declining forced them towards further despair, steadfastly attempting to preserve the meagre resources for sustenance, for those earning on the daily it’d turned harrowing enough for them to either perish or flee to other locations. For those who had could save enough for them to lead reasonably comfortable lives, they too had their troubles in their own ways, be it with their jobs, or protecting their families from falling ill. The wealthy were, as always shielded from the fallout, lavishly going about their ways, even growing richer, but they too struggled with the disease, although to a much trivial degree, the virus it seemed wasn’t prejudiced, nobody worried about them though, but themselves. One predominant inclusion to the previous year was frustration, then was a first tryst with the predicament for the inhabitants, this time reliving events of last year was venturing to impede the pot from boiling over.
