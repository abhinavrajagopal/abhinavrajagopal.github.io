Days([^1]) cycle by over the marginally arid land, bringing no respite to the soil thirsty for some hydration, trees stretch their splaying roots along their boundaries but are disdainfully stopped in their tracks by concoctions of concrete and metal woefully restraining the flora from unravelling their expanse, the place sustains a tranquil silence except for the occasional chirping of squirrels and mynas tottering along branches, cuckoos and pigeons cooing, crows cawing, cows mooing for their calves, hopping, hiding within the constrained foliage of boughs, suspended cables and walls. Rain has been unpunctual this year for the land, taking on a rather dubious, arbitrary nonchalant evocation of its people. It comes in heavy, short spells, at times going longer and showering enough to run full freshet through asphalt laden paths, marshalling strewn leaves, twigs, mustering muck, quenching the land and trees, promising a few months satiation. People here have a penchant for dissatisfaction, similar to most people, a mental construct of melancholic void of resources from the gods and nature, ironically enough preventing, encumbering the latter every step of their way in an attempt to conquer it. Every time a week of rain brings them joy, which lasts as long as the time itself, bridging the lack of it, until they turn vexed during the other times, the sweltering radiation from the sun bakes, toasts the dry land into further the humidity, a detriment of a costal sea bordering land. Winds drifts aplenty, one prime mover of dust and air around this city. During times of blessing, the living rejoice as one community, from birds, buds impeded from blooming flowers to humans. The people go about their plundering, casting along their wake, gathering land, planting food if they found the soil turned fallow, acquiring property, engineer and constructing concrete towers and encampments to their design to house, sell, live, and folly. During dry times, they grow sadder, and forget about the good times, longing for a break from the heat. In fact, it had rained more than usual that past year according to the meteorological data compared with the last couple decades. It has been a year and half that the cyclical entrapments of time have grown to suffocating heights that bring no dousing of calamity to mind, body and spirit of these people. This year has been kinder, the summer got off to a torturous start bringing more despair amidst catastrophic loss, as if the gods were taking pity, the month of May turned around to witness some rain, which was a rarity, bringing probably the only respite to the city and its inhabitants. When you think about it, both man and nature do right by themselves, although contentious within one another, their dichotomy embroiled in a quest for survival. But all is not so healthy with the natural world. The human mind greedily probing, innovating, inventing new ways to take after being continually crevassed for its resources there comes a time when man does gain an upper hand, there have been increasingly frequent quakes, cyclones, tornadoes, temperature shifts and warming of the oceans, atmosphere, seasonal alterations, oblique precipitation patterns, and a disharmony seething with rage bubbling underneath the surface, we’re in dire straits here, thee thought. There is the catastrophe that we mentioned, a pandemic in which the global equilibrium was shackled, ousted into living in fear, loss and hope. No one knew how it began, or started, transmitted, and travelled all over the world, but few guessed about as they always do. The reality of this city and its country was that they did not care or couldn’t do so for they had tragically misplaced their lives for a trade with the grim reaper. Times had changed for the city and the country at large, their leaders, government and those wielding power grew increasingly narcissistic, megalomaniacal, bigoted and stupid. It’s not that the previous governments weren’t, but they served the people rather than ruled or enforced, despite their tendency to loot or squander. And so it had become that the powers that be had decided to celebrate their victory over this pandemic a tad too early, it was now May but their Prime and Health ministers had declared themselves triumphant over this virus back in January, a cardinal sin. Bureaucrats have turned sycophantic underlings of their masters, their only motivation to safeguard their jobs, when they formerly held them accountable.
