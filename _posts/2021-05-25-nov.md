Days[^1] cycle by over the marginally arid land, bringing no respite to the soil thirsty for some hydration, trees stretch their splaying roots along their boundaries but are disdainfully stopped in their tracks by concoctions of concrete and metal woefully restraining the flora from unravelling their expanse, the place sustains a tranquil silence, the streets wearing a desolated look, except for the occasional chirping of squirrels and mynas tottering along branches, cuckoos and pigeons cooing, crows cawing, cows mooing for their calves, hopping, hiding within the constrained foliage of boughs, suspended cables and walls. Rain has been unpunctual this year for the land, taking on a rather dubious, arbitrary nonchalant evocation of its people. It draws in with teasing petrichor, heavy, short spells, at times going longer and showering enough to run full freshet through asphalt laden paths, marshalling strewn leaves, twigs, mustering muck, quenching the land and trees, promising a few months satiation. People here have a penchant for dissatisfaction, similar to most people, a mental construct of melancholic void of resources from the gods and nature, ironically enough preventing, encumbering the latter every step of their way in an attempt to conquer it. Every time a week of rain brings them joy, which lasts as long as the time itself, bridging the lack of it, until they turn vexed during the other times, the sweltering radiation from the sun bakes, toasts the dry land into further the humidity, a detriment of a costal sea bordering land. Wind currents drift aplenty, one prime mover of dust and air around this city, and the summer stretches oblong. During times of blessing, the living rejoice as one community, from birds, buds impeded from blooming flowers to humans. The people go about their plundering, casting ploughed matter along their wake, gathering land, planting food if they found the soil turned fallow, acquiring property, engineer and constructing concrete towers and encampments with their designs to house, sell, live, procreate, and folly. During dry times, they grow sadder, and forget about the good times, longing for a break from the heat. In fact, it had rained more than usual that past year according to the meteorological data compared with the last couple decades. It has been a year and half that the cyclical entrapments of time have grown to suffocating heights that bring no dousing of calamity to mind, body and spirit of these people. Sweltering heat had been creeping up over the years, forcing the people more often to seek shelter amid shadows, or indoors, and blissfully engage in hydrating with coconut water, palm jelly, melon juice, lemonade, and rose milk shared between howls of laughter and gossip. This year has been kinder, the summer got off to a torturous start bringing more despair amidst catastrophic loss, as if the gods were taking pity, the month of May turned around to witness some rain, which was a rarity, bringing probably the only respite to the city and its inhabitants. When you think about it, both man and nature do right by themselves, although contentious within one another, their dichotomy embroiled in a quest for survival. But all is not so healthy with the natural world. The human mind greedily probing, innovating, inventing new ways to expand his dominion, after being continually crevassed for its resources there comes a time when man does gain an upper hand and nature seem obsequious, when high rises are built towering over the trees, with the booming population density, as opposed to a time when houses stood only as tall as a tree, if not shorter. There have been increasingly frequent quakes, cyclones, tornadoes, ensuing deluges, temperature shifts and warming of the oceans, atmosphere, seasonal alterations, oblique precipitation patterns, carrying death and destruction along the way, and a disharmony seething with rage bubbling underneath the surface, we’re in dire straits here, thee thought. There is the catastrophe that we mentioned, a pandemic in which the global equilibrium was shackled, ousted into living in fear, loss and hope. No one knew how it began, or started, transmitted, and travelled all over the world, but few speculated about as they always do. The reality of this city and the country was that they did not care or couldn’t do so for they had tragically misplaced their lives for a trade with the grim reaper. Times had changed for the city and the country at large, their elected, government and those wielding power grew increasingly narcissistic, megalomaniacal, bigoted, stupid and seemed to have ulterior motives. It’s not that the previous ones weren’t, but they attempted to serve the people rather than rule or coerce their wills down their throats, despite their tendency to loot or squander. And so it had become that the powers that be had decided to celebrate their victory over this pandemic a tad too early, it was now May but their Prime and Health ministers had declared themselves triumphant over this virus back in January, a cardinal sin. People, having an instinct for the wild by nature, and being deprived of some of their freedom, awaited the authorities’ word as the assent on the matter, now resumed their wildness. Bureaucrats have turned sycophantic underlings of their masters, their motivation being to not jeopardise their jobs, when they formerly held them accountable and led their efforts to bulwark the integrity of their systems. On the other side, desperation and frugality among people was beginning to rear it’s head, resources were stringent, and money reserves rapidly declining forced them towards further despair, steadfastly attempting to preserve the meagre resources for sustenance, for those earning on the daily it’d turned harrowing enough for them to either perish or flee to other locations. For those who had could save enough for them to lead reasonably comfortable lives, they too had their troubles in their own ways, be it with their jobs, or protecting their families from succumbing to illness. The wealthy were, as always shielded from the fallout, lavishly going about their ways, even growing richer, but they too struggled with the disease, although to a much trivial degree, the virus it seemed wasn’t prejudiced, nobody worried about them though, but themselves. One predominant inclusion to the previous year was frustration, then was a first tryst with the predicament for the inhabitants, this time reliving events of last year was venturing to impede the pot from boiling over.

The city of Chennai is a quaint, magnanimous, serene coalescence in north eastern Tamil Nadu, a fledgling city on the eastern Coromandel coast, alongside the sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the seemingly interminable coastline with their beaches as a beckoning soothing presence in hot months, and a vortex billow of turbulent volatility as ever during the late monsoon. The days fry the land and people, the sun was a radiant, beaming fireball which seemed to mercilessly peer down in close proximity during summers, and the nights are hotter, sweating profusely, and the moisture suspended in the air, if they had a choice they would keep clothing minimal and remain in their abodes, quenching with water, lackadaisically attempting to enjoy the time is the norm. It is not what we could call a big city, its contemporaries were generally larger in square kilometres, it was bounded to contain seven million people, regions and subdivisions with their various constraints of dividing land. It required only a spell of rain in the spring or summer, the land would break forth with blooming flowers, not that it warranted the rain, but we could sense a satiation and happiness within the trees, plants, animals and birds when spring came with it’s shock of green. The city also humbly bragged of several lakes, which once upon a time, brimmed with water for the majority of a yearly sojourn and everyone around was happy. Chennai or as it was known then, Madras, was usually a bustling, at times chaotic, rollicking and pious confluence of idiosyncrasies. Ravishing temples, churches and monuments rose, stood immaculately high against the radiant sunshine, and teeming roads. Beaches, temples, and festivals were the attraction for most people living in the city. Festivals always came with their fervour, excitement rent the air when even a minor festival was around the corner, families and patriarchs felt younger, went outside merrily to the bazaars, shops, purchasing goodies, materials mainly food, clothes and memorabilia to their heart’s content, chattering in loud voices, bickering sometimes, haggling with sellers, relishing in the sweets and savouries from the local street shops’ who only it seemed, to magically spring up when an event or a festival was around. Along with festivals, some events brought in people travelling hitherto, also went to and fro from their own villages, towns and brought back their families, people from other states or regions migrated into the city during these transient periods where local business boomed more often than not. The streets led to uncannily narrow lanes, whereas the roads stood moderately broad, where it was used to overflowing with traffic. The roads and streets carried whimsical names, for most carried their names from back when the British had altered them with their counterparts, so it trickled through down the years, the roads and some streets had names as the viceroys, ministers and other British Raj stand outs who had administered during their Presidency of Madras. 

The month of April and May brought conspicuous blithe Gulmohars, neem, banyan, peepul, and the local flowers to their zenith, come morning wasps and bees hummed lazily about, droning in on flowers, carried along the breeze, tree fruits dancing effervescently to their scent, traversed around them, playfully engaging in combat in mid air, drinking the nectar, pollinating, building hive homes, nesting their eggs, zooming around people’s windows. Yellow flowers laid strewn about on the roads, where they seemed to endlessly fall in abundance, creating the paths where they stayed root to shout in a dazzling golden mess. Mango trees got heavier, until they could no longer hold their fruits by their slender threads, moringa trees grew drumsticks longer than their branches, their pods and leaves were harvested and made for a delicacy, water and musk melon shops on the streets ran busy, and so did coconut and palm. Seasonal delicacies grew more lucrative to the palates, relishing in the local favourites, of which the mangoes, buttermilk, Indian sarsaparilla which had an aromatic enticing flavour when sherbets were extracted, cucumbers, koozh a porridge like concoction of nutrition, and shots of Jigarthanda which is a portmanteau of ‘cool’ and ‘heart’, couldn’t be missed.

It was an ephemeral, existential period or so it seemed for the country, months moving from one stage of the pandemic to the next over the period of 2020 and the following year, optimistic people were hellbent on striving for it when non was to be found over the myriad of destruction in ever lasting hope of tunnelling through to the light, telltale signs of the light was casting mirages of light beams to bore through the dark path but to no avail, as tenacious as they fought to discover a beacon, only to be crestfallen on the resulting tomfoolery. Ensuing chaos notwithstanding in their minds, gathered up all their resilience for the oncoming trajectory they followed to find their next solace in the interminable mirage of hope. Pessimists remained as they were, the naysayers, withering away to their innate mental decadence, neither offering any empathy to others in their downtrodden haplessness, nor to prevent their own savagery from this interstitial purgatory fallout, and so they embraced it with their heart. Others, struggling with their mortality, the majority of them, at wits end, torn between the ridiculous apathy of the virus, their government, their people, and their inherent hope to survive, admonished at themselves to keep moving onwards in their bleak tunnel paths to beams of light which led to more junctions of darker tunnels promising a cataclysmic month with a few kilograms of hope to fuel their engines for the next month of pathfinding tunnel heading towards an exit portal. Naïvely, or not, the promise of an exit strategy was aware to only be discussed among the higher ranks of the government, whether or not it was an informed, grounded in scientific rigour, procuring enough resources to fend their own people was itself a daunting task all of a sudden cometh the summer, only it seemed that conscientious ministers who had deemed themselves victorious from the virus were steadfastly proving themselves wronger every other day since January, only not being prudent to stock, supply, vaccinate their citizens over a disease that was novel and had no cure, and sought to redeem their dwindling repute, clout that they had toiled for to architect over the last seven years of their tenure, as much as a farmer did for his crop, even if the jaws of the virus bore viciously into the alveoli of people’s lungs.
