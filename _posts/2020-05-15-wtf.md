title: What the fuck?
---
Well, I guess that's all I've to say. What, you may ask. Well, it's obvious isn't it, this post is nothing but a acidic reflux response from the last of the functioning neurons in my brain or as they say in the memes, as your last brain cell leaves you. Also, looks like it's my first post of this year, ah. 

Again, what the fuck. Kinda sums up this year and it's May. It feels like it's been ages already, carrying on from the last year's work, I'd wanted to cover so much more ground in the first three months of this year. Things seemed to be going decently too, and were looking quite interesting, and then the virus hit. 

BAM! That's it.

I don't know, this is hurting even for someone like me who is used to being alone, and asocial, meaning I could just fucking live out without human interaction other than the usual once a week chores like grocery shopping or some shit. 

Alright, I'm gonna go now, this has probably been the most unproductive period of life so far, as in haven't done shit. Even getting enough neurons to fire together to do the simplest task is hard as pulling a heavy set of deadlifts, so I'm just resorting to reliving old memories over in my head these days mostly, that seems easier. 

Ok, that's all, I guess I'll write something more later, when I feel better about things and hoping the world does soon too..
