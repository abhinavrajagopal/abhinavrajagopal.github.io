title: In The End
---
Wow, we made it. We made it through. Huffing, puffing and dragging our feet through the dirt as we inched closer and closer to an end while the unknowable, unpredictable future lies ahead. It is quite surreal to look back on everything, some of us went through and dealt with personal discomfits, transients, tragedies and shit we never saw coming others such as the medical workforce, frontline workers went through annd dealt with the tragedy of an populace inflicted with an invisible antigen while being at most times overburdened, all this while nature took a little break and breathed and the world itself had a collective existential crisis.
