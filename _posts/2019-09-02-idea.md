title: The Art of Ideas
---
I was recently coversing with my friend after a long time, and this time he who usually espouses ideas aplenty, had more
to offer than could be comprehended by my little pea brain. (laughs in self-deprecation)
But after I bid my goodbyes, as I was staring out into the vast abyss of modern civilization as I rode home, I was gently experiencing 
a stream of thoughts, some of which escaped me immediately then, but whatever is left of that I'm trying to pen down before I lost that as well.

So, coming back, these vast number of ideas that my friend was purging onto me over zealously, I was led to believe whatever they were 
could some day be viable enough to fruition before my eyes. But my cynical self got the better of me later on, as I couldn't belive 
the things I'd heard could ever come into reality all at once, of course that would be too fantastical.
But stepping back and taking a look at the larger picture, I was again led into an epiphany of an idea, that the whole world is brimming with it,
and my friends' was no different than what was happening at some pitching rounds in business or VC meetings, on various other parts of the world.
Like I'd heard repeated several times throughout my educational sojourn, having ideas anyone could come up with, only the ones that make it 
through it to reality would be the ones that ever mattered. But, I felt another twitch that ideas themselves held some inherent value.

Patents, for example do exactly that. With enough rigour of an idea, a successful invention is tied to the inventor's technical prowess for the rest of their lives, even if their inventions never see the light of the day.
But then comes the various kinds of ideas that people could have, not just technological ones. 
Where does that get registered other than someone's personal journal or pitching meetings. Maybe there's a certain value threshold to having worthy ideas,
that ought to be held to the authorized person's mind. But even when it comes to such advancements in technology, not every idea is held on patent by he person 
that came up with thing, rather these days held by large business units or corporations. Nothing with that would or be possible to attempted to implementation
other than the holder, or with the persons' rights being given via legal documents or monetary compensation. Then there is the whole clusterfuck of intellectual property and
arm twisting and enforcing of such property of which the authority of whatever idea or invention has to commit towards to gain some kind of competitive advantage
over their peers or the market. Some even adopt such practices into holding authority over such intellectual property as their sole business models and can just live off granting
rights to their peers or other such communities so that somehow their licenses are what is ruling over a certain aspect of a technological field or any other field where their ideas
can gain real world realisations. Working together as a team would be a contrasting nature of this practise, not just for the sake of granting licenses and IP to their realisers, but to promote
the actual benefit that such an act would do, not just for the realisation of an idea but also for encouraging healthy business practises.
Successful Research & development would be a utopian reality if the practices of having solely authority over an invention and having the freedom to implement that 
in several other efficient ways were to be encouraged. Instead, humongous time and resources are being dedicated to just hampering any such progress that wouldn't occur as 
a result of more cooperative, selfess work.

There's this whole necessity to only work towards realising ideas that actually help in fostering growth of a community, or in a larger scale an enterprise, or a nation, into 
incremental development of their social, scientific, technological and economical norms. But what of the ideas that are only able to be pertained to obscure fields, which may or may not provide 
the immediate sleight of hand in some advancements required by certain organisations or communities? Are they actually worthy of pursuit and funding? What deems ideas that are worthy of pursuit? Maybe some require immediate
planning and action, and some maybe not so imminent enough to obtain resource pooling, and just get tragically discarded into the bowels of a person's mind or an organisation.

That is a complex issue to tackle that would warrant discussion with teams of experts maybe, but surely if such ideas are worthy of being pursued for the long term, they better be adequately funded or worked upon by teams that hold both consistent belief in their pursuit and are able to 
work on them consistently without any managerial or other interferences that might hamper their freedom within their organisations to experiment.

Some of that hard work over decades, done by various people over their lifetimes, may just fizzle out into oblivion in the current strata of rapid change in societies today,
scientific research comes to mind, but may find a rebirth centuries later, however obscure it may seem at first, both the current work done by the work done and the future. But that is all probably just
a shot in the dark, but the shot is to be taken nevertheless by those persevering.

Consolidation of said technological advancements if any, being held by groups of people or corporations, would prove to be a bummer if in case the idea is better 
held in the hands of someone who is both willing to and having resources to implement said idea into reality.

That being said, it isn't always a black or white kind of dichotomy we have here, it is essentially the way the world works, in the sense of how the human civilisation 
works it's ways. Like most things, when there is an advantage, we'll have a couple cons in there as well. Not only to my purely cynical mind that is the case, but 
otherwise too, is such varied events of grey taking place all the time around me that even the optimist in me thinks it's just reality, however equivocal at times it may seem.

So, what good are such varied ideas that one person with the intellectual capacity and cognitive capability has come up with due to his ablility to gather his thoughts,
knowledge and other mental constructs? For one, only the ones capable and privileged enough to do so can be able to quip such things, and even then it's only from their 
experiences and knowledge can they propel their mental thoughts and motives into forming a composed sense of gathering their accumulated emotions into ideas that they feel 
could be actually worthy of recursively growing from within their minds into taking form as implemented structures in our world.

But the notion of several ideas forming concurrently, and with completely different goals, are to be witnessed with the passage of time, and the evolution of those ideas
over time, if the thinker persists along with them that is. Having several of them might not necessarily be a regressive outcome of results for the person,
but it may just hamper the potential of driving just one of them into progress, rather than have all of them at once to end up in procrastination and redundancy.
Not saying that is deemed to occur, but most times that tends to be the case, instead I find myself increasingly believing in the KISS principle and even more so with the UNIX philosophy,
maybe as an unintended upshot stemming from working with such systems, and then there is Occam's razor to top it all off.

Again, just merely having ideas about something wouldn't necessarily propel a person towards achieving their goals, but if one persists in evolving them into
actual viable, economical concepts, and are willing to conscientiously move towards them, then maybe it's only a matter of time before they witness their brain children taking form before them, maybe even before they leave their mortal selves if they are lucky enough.
